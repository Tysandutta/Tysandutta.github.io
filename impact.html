            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <a> Biking and walking uses no fuel and does not require toxic batteries or motor oil to work. You will be helping with reducing traffic and reducing trans emissions in the air. Biking and running do not require as much energy as a car. Cycling and running would reduce the need to produce cars. In the US painting and coating cars produces 24 millions pounds of hazardous waste every year!   </a>
